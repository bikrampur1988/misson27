 ** When it comes to running commands on Windows, PowerShell has become somewhat of an ace in the     hole.

 ** For years enthusiasts were limited to the confines of the Windows command line but in 2006,      PowerShell emerged as a powerful alternative.

 1. What is Windows PowerShell?
  PowerShell is an interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) and automation engine designed 
  by Microsoft to help design system configurations
  and automate administrative tasks.

  This tool has its own command-line with a unique programming language similar to Perl. 
  Initially, PowerShell was designed to manage objects on users’ computers.
  Today PowerShell offers users an extensive environment where they can execute and automate system     management tasks. 

  The user can access resources from Active Directory to 
  Exchange Server through one program. At its core, PowerShell allows the user to access:
  Command Prompt.

  PowerShell Commands:
  * .NET Framework API
  * Windows Management Instrumentation
  * Windows Component Object Model

  ** As PowerShell has become an open-source application:
  Linux and Unix-based users can now access this versatile platform.
  PowerShell’s is mainly used to help users automate administrative jobs.

 ** Rather than performing tedious and repetitive tasks, the user can simply create scripts and issue    commands,and PowerShell will complete them automatically.
 
 ** The user can customize hundreds of commands, called cmdlets.
